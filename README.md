# Everlook Classic Launcher
Allows you to play on [Everlook.org](https://everlook.org/) with modern 1.14 WoW Client!

## Easy setup
The launcher will do everything for you.  
It will download the 1.14 client, setup HermesProxy and launch the game.

1. **Download [the latest release](https://github.com/0blu/EverlookClassicLauncher/releases)**
2. Place it in a separate directory (On first launch it will create subfolders and a desktop icon)
3. Run it
4. **Enjoy your stay on Everlook**

## Why
The modern WoW-Classic client provides many improvements in hardware compatibility and accessibility.

With Everlook we have the unique chance to improve HermesProxy with a large testing audience.   
The launcher will make the classic client accessible to everyone.  
So if you find any bugs [please report them](https://github.com/WowLegacyCore/HermesProxy/issues/new/choose).

## Is this allowed?
Currently HermesProxy is tolerated on Everlook.  
You will get suspended if you exploit any game breaking bugs.  
Just use common sense and <u>**play fair**</u>!

## Addons
Most addons for 1.14.x should work.  
You can download older versions from CurseForge under the "Files" tab. ([Example](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/questie/files/all?filter-game-version=2020709689%3A9094))
